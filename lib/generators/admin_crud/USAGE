Description:
    Generate a complete admin CRUD interface for an existing model.
    This generator automatically detects model fields and creates controller, views, and updates
    routes and admin sidebar.

    IMPORTANT: The model must already exist before using this generator.

Example:
    bin/rails generate admin_crud Product

    This will create:
        Controller:  app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb
        Views:       app/views/admin/products/index.html.erb
                     app/views/admin/products/show.html.erb
                     app/views/admin/products/new.html.erb
                     app/views/admin/products/edit.html.erb
        Routes:      Updates config/routes.rb with admin namespace
        Sidebar:     Updates app/views/shared/admin/_sidebar.html.erb

Prerequisites:
    The model must exist before running this generator. If the model doesn't exist,
    you'll see an error message with instructions to create it first.

    Example:
    bin/rails generate model Product name:string description:text price:decimal active:boolean
    bin/rails db:migrate
    bin/rails generate admin_crud Product

Features:
    - Automatically detects all model fields (except id, created_at, updated_at)
    - Generates appropriate form fields based on column types
    - Creates responsive tables with pagination support (Kaminari)
    - Includes proper validation error handling
    - Updates admin sidebar with menu item
    - Follows daisyUI design patterns

Supported field types:
    string, text, integer, decimal, float, boolean, date, datetime, timestamp, time

Model Requirements:
    - Model must inherit from ApplicationRecord
