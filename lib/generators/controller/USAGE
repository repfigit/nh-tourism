Description:
    Enhanced controller generator that replaces Rails built-in controller generator.
    Creates controller with smart routing, authentication options, and comprehensive tests.

    Works like standard Rails controller generator but with better defaults.

Examples:
    rails generate controller Product                     # All CRUD actions (resources)
    rails generate controller Product index show         # Only specified actions  
    rails generate controller Product --auth             # With authentication
    rails generate controller Profile --single           # Singular resource (no index)
    rails generate controller Profile show edit --single # Singular resource with specific actions

Generated Files:
    Controller:  app/controllers/products_controller.rb (with action stubs)
    Routes:      Updates config/routes.rb (resources with smart only: options)
    Tests:       spec/requests/products_spec.rb (comprehensive request tests)

Options:
    --auth      Adds before_action :authenticate_user!
    --single    Generate singular resource (resource vs resources, no index action)

Actions:
    Default: index, show, new, edit (with create, update, destroy)
    Custom:  Specify actions: index show new edit

Features:
    - Smart routing (only necessary routes, no extra ones)
    - Authentication support with --auth flag  
    - Singular resource support with --single flag
    - Clean GET request tests for all actions
    - Works without requiring existing model
    - Clean action stubs ready for implementation
    - Protected controller names (sessions, registrations, etc.)

Protected Names (will be rejected):
    sessions, registrations, passwords, profiles, invitations, omniauth, orders
    Choose different names for these controllers.
