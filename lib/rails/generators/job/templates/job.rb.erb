  # Configure retry strategy
  # retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3
  # discard_on ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound

  # IMPORTANT: Do NOT catch exceptions and swallow them!
  # BAD:
  #   rescue => e
  #     Rails.logger.error(e)
  #     # Error is hidden, job appears successful
  #   end
  #
  # GOOD: Let exceptions propagate naturally
  #   rescue => e
  #     Rails.logger.error(e)
  #     raise  # Re-raise to trigger retry/failure handling
  #   end
  #
  # Why: Development uses inline mode for immediate feedback.
  #      Production has GoodJob dashboard to track failures.
